# N-Bit-ALU-with-3bit-Control-Pin-and-4bit-Control-Pin
Designed n-bit ALU with 3bit and 4bit control pin using verilog in vivado 


ALU is a fundamental component of a CPU responsible for
executing arithmetic and logical operations. Verilog provides a convenient and
efficient way to design and implement an ALU. By utilizing modular design
principles and appropriate control logic, we can create a versatile and efficient
ALU that meets the computational requirements of modern computing
systems.
In this Project we wrote verilog code for n-bit ALU with 3-bit and 4-bit control
pin. In place of n we can give 4 to get 4 bit ALU, we can give 8 to get 8 bit
ALU,16 to give 16bit ALU and 32 to get 32bit ALU.
